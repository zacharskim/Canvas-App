# Canvas-App


## About
Currently, this project is a canvas-based text editor built using pure javascript and html. It supports some features 'normal' text editors have, like copy/paste as well as some other features that make it a little unique. See table below for more details.


| Action        | Short-Cut          
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
| copy      | `ctrl-c` | 
| paste      | `ctrl-v`      | 
| move image | `shift-h/j/k/i`      | 
| move text |   `shift-h/j/k/i`    | 



## Writing Text
There are two modes in this app, text mode and navigation mode. Hit `i` to enter text mode and `esc` to enter naviagtion mode. Text can only be written, selected, pasted, etc in text mode.
